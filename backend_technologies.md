# Backend and API Technologies

This document outlines the backend and API technologies used in the project.

## Concise Summary

The backend is a Node.js application using the Express.js framework. It handles authentication with Passport.js (including OAuth for Google, GitHub, and Microsoft) and JWTs. The project uses Jest for testing, Nodemailer for email, and various other libraries for security and API development.

## Detailed Summary

The project's backend is built on Node.js and the Express.js framework, creating a RESTful API. Authentication is a key feature, implemented using Passport.js, which supports both traditional login and OAuth 2.0 with providers like Google, GitHub, and Microsoft. JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are used for securing API endpoints.

For security, the application uses `bcryptjs` to hash user passwords and `helmet` to protect against common web vulnerabilities by setting appropriate HTTP headers. `cors` is enabled to control cross-origin requests.

The application includes email functionality via `nodemailer`. Data validation is handled by `joi`, and `morgan` is used for logging HTTP requests.

The development and testing stack includes `jest` for running tests, `supertest` for making HTTP assertions against the API, and `nodemon` for an improved development workflow. Environment variables are managed using `dotenv`. The data storage method is not explicitly defined by a database driver in the dependencies, suggesting it might be file-based or in-memory.

## Full Technology List

Based on the project's dependencies, the backend and API are built with the following technologies:

*   **Core Framework: Node.js with Express.js**
    *   **Why:** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows us to build fast and scalable server-side applications. Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is used to build the RESTful API that serves as the backbone of the application.
*   **Authentication: Passport.js & `jsonwebtoken` (JWT)**
    *   **Why:** Passport.js is a flexible and modular authentication middleware for Node.js. It provides a comprehensive set of "strategies" to support authentication using a username and password, as well as OAuth providers like Google, GitHub, and Microsoft. `jsonwebtoken` is used to create and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are a standard and secure way to represent claims between two parties. This is used to secure the API endpoints and ensure that only authenticated users can access protected resources.
*   **Database/Data: In-memory/File-based**
    *   **Why:** For this project, the data is stored in-memory and in files within the `src/data` directory. This approach was chosen for its simplicity and to avoid the need for a separate database server, which is suitable for a project of this scale.
*   **API & Communication:**
    *   **RESTful API with Express.js:**
        *   **Why:** A RESTful API is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to create, read, update, and delete resources. Express.js is used to build this API, providing a clear and organized way to define the API endpoints and handle requests.
    *   **`nodemailer`:**
        *   **Why:** `nodemailer` is a module for Node.js applications to allow easy as cake email sending. It is used to send emails for various purposes, such as registration confirmation, password resets, and other notifications to the users.
*   **Security:**
    *   **`bcryptjs`:**
        *   **Why:** `bcryptjs` is used to hash passwords before storing them. Hashing is a one-way process that converts a password into a fixed-length string of characters. This is a critical security measure that protects user passwords even if the data store is compromised.
    *   **`helmet`:**
        *   **Why:** `helmet` helps secure the Express.js application by setting various HTTP headers. These headers protect against common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other attacks.
    *   **`cors`:**
        *   **Why:** `cors` is a Node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing with various options. This is necessary because the frontend and backend are served from different origins, and this middleware allows the frontend to make requests to the backend API.
*   **Development & Testing:**
    *   **`jest`:**
        *   **Why:** Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. It is used to write and run unit and integration tests for the backend code, ensuring that the application is reliable and free of bugs.
    *   **`supertest`:**
        *   **Why:** `supertest` is a library for testing Node.js HTTP servers. It provides a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP, while still allowing you to drop down to the lower-level API provided by `superagent`. It is used to write integration tests for the API endpoints.
    *   **`nodemon`:**
        *   **Why:** `nodemon` is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. This significantly speeds up the development process by avoiding the need to manually restart the server after every change.
*   **Other Libraries:**
    *   **`joi`:**
        *   **Why:** `joi` is a powerful schema description language and data validator for JavaScript. It is used to validate incoming data on the API endpoints, ensuring that the data is in the correct format and meets the required constraints. This helps to prevent errors and improve the overall security of the application.
    *   **`morgan`:**
        *   **Why:** `morgan` is an HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js. It logs information about incoming requests to the console, which is very useful for debugging and monitoring the application's activity.
    *   **`dotenv`:**
        *   **Why:** `dotenv` is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. This is a best practice for managing application configuration, as it allows for separating configuration from code and keeping sensitive information like API keys out of the version control system.
