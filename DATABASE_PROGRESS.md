# Database Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Database Setup ✅ COMPLETED

### Accomplishments:

1. **PostgreSQL Database Setup**
   - Database: `jacs_shiftpilot`
   - User: `jacs_admin`
   - Connection established and verified

2. **Prisma ORM Installation**
   - Installed `@prisma/client` and `prisma` packages
   - Initialized Prisma with PostgreSQL provider
   - Configured shadow database for migrations

3. **Database Schema Design**
   Created comprehensive schema with **11 models**:
   - **User** - Authentication and user accounts
   - **Profile** - User profile information with preferences
   - **Skill** - Available skills catalog
   - **VolunteerSkill** - Junction table for user skills with proficiency
   - **Availability** - User availability time slots
   - **Event** - Volunteer events
   - **EventRequirement** - Required skills for events
   - **Assignment** - Volunteer-event assignments
   - **VolunteerHistory** - Historical participation records
   - **Notification** - User notifications
   - **State** - US states reference data

   Created **8 enums** for type safety:
   - Role (VOLUNTEER, ADMIN)
   - EventStatus (DRAFT, PUBLISHED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)
   - UrgencyLevel (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
   - AssignmentStatus (PENDING, CONFIRMED, DECLINED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED)
   - ParticipationStatus (REGISTERED, CONFIRMED, COMPLETED, NO_SHOW, CANCELLED)
   - AttendanceType (PRESENT, ABSENT, LATE, EXCUSED)
   - ProficiencyLevel (BEGINNER, INTERMEDIATE, ADVANCED, EXPERT)
   - NotificationType (ASSIGNMENT, REMINDER, EVENT_UPDATE, MATCHING_SUGGESTION, ANNOUNCEMENT, SYSTEM)
   - NotificationPriority (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT)

4. **Database Migration**
   - Created initial migration: `20251014171722_init`
   - Applied migration successfully
   - All tables created with proper:
     - Primary keys (UUIDs)
     - Foreign keys with cascading deletes
     - Indexes and unique constraints
     - Timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)

5. **Repository Layer**
   Created 5 repository classes:
   - **userRepository.js** - 20+ methods for user/profile operations
   - **skillRepository.js** - Skill management and search
   - **eventRepository.js** - Event and assignment operations
   - **historyRepository.js** - Volunteer history tracking
   - **notificationRepository.js** - Notification management

6. **Data Migration (Seed Script)**
   Successfully seeded database with:
   - ✅ 50 US states
   - ✅ 25 skills across multiple categories
   - ✅ 5 users (1 admin, 4 volunteers)
   - ✅ 5 complete profiles with preferences
   - ✅ 6 events with requirements
   - ✅ Volunteer skills and availability

7. **Verification**
   - Database connection tested ✅
   - All data confirmed present ✅
   - Queries executing correctly ✅

## Current Status

**Database Infrastructure: 100% Complete**

The database layer is fully functional and ready for service integration. All tables are created, populated with seed data, and the repository layer provides a clean abstraction for data access.

## Next Steps: Service Migration

Now we need to gradually migrate services to use the Prisma repositories instead of in-memory data structures.

### Recommended Migration Order:

1. **authService** (Foundation)
   - User authentication
   - User registration
   - Password management
   - Already has good test coverage

2. **profileService** (User Data)
   - Profile management
   - Skills management
   - Availability management

3. **eventService** (Core Feature)
   - Event CRUD operations
   - Assignment management
   - Event statistics

4. **historyService** (Tracking)
   - Volunteer history
   - Performance metrics
   - Statistics

5. **notificationService** (Communication)
   - Notification creation
   - Notification management
   - User preferences

6. **matchingService** (Algorithm)
   - Matching algorithm (uses data from other services)
   - Should be last as it depends on all others

### Migration Strategy:

For each service:
1. Update service to use repository instead of in-memory data
2. Handle async/await (all database operations are async)
3. Update error handling for Prisma errors
4. Update tests to mock Prisma instead of in-memory data
5. Run tests to ensure coverage remains 80%+
6. Verify functionality works end-to-end

### Test Strategy:

We need to update tests to work with Prisma. Two approaches:

**Option 1: Mock Prisma Client** (Faster, unit tests)
- Mock Prisma calls in tests
- No real database needed for tests
- Faster test execution
- Better for CI/CD

**Option 2: Test Database** (Integration tests)
- Use real test database
- More realistic testing
- Slower but catches more issues
- Better for critical paths

**Recommended: Hybrid Approach**
- Mock Prisma for unit tests
- Use test database for integration tests
- Keep current test coverage above 80%

## Files Created

### Database Schema & Configuration
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Complete database schema
- `prisma/migrations/20251014171722_init/` - Initial migration
- `.env` - Database connection strings (not in git)
- `.env.example` - Template for environment variables

### Repository Layer
- `src/database/prisma.js` - Prisma client singleton
- `src/database/repositories/userRepository.js`
- `src/database/repositories/skillRepository.js`
- `src/database/repositories/eventRepository.js`
- `src/database/repositories/historyRepository.js`
- `src/database/repositories/notificationRepository.js`
- `src/database/repositories/index.js` - Repository exports

### Scripts
- `prisma/seed.js` - Database seeding script
- `test-db-connection.js` - Database verification script

### Documentation
- `DATABASE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Full implementation guide
- `DATABASE_PROGRESS.md` - This file

## Git Status

- ✅ .env files removed from version control
- ✅ Database files ready to commit
- ✅ Currently on `Database` branch
- ⏳ Ready to commit database implementation

## Assignment 4 Compliance

**Requirements Met:**

- ✅ Database created (PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Required tables: UserCredentials (User), UserProfile (Profile), EventDetails (Event), VolunteerHistory, States
- ✅ Field validations (via Prisma schema)
- ✅ Data retrieval functionality (repositories)
- ✅ Data persistence (Prisma ORM)
- ✅ Seed data populated
- ⏳ Unit tests (need to update for Prisma)
- ⏳ 80%+ code coverage (currently 84.77%, need to maintain)

**Deliverables Status:**

- ✅ GitHub repository link
- ✅ SQL statements/schema (Prisma schema + migration SQL)
- ⏳ Code coverage report (need to re-run after service migration)
- ⏳ Team contributions document

## Technical Debt & Notes

1. **Test Migration** - Priority #1
   - Tests currently use in-memory data
   - Need to update to mock Prisma or use test database
   - Must maintain 80%+ coverage

2. **Service Migration** - Gradual approach
   - Don't migrate all services at once
   - One service at a time, verify tests pass
   - Keep both old and new code working during transition

3. **Error Handling**
   - Need to handle Prisma-specific errors (P2002, P2025, etc.)
   - Add error handling utilities for common cases

4. **Performance**
   - Add indexes if queries are slow
   - Use connection pooling for production
   - Consider caching for read-heavy operations

5. **Documentation**
   - Add inline JSDoc comments to repositories
   - Document common query patterns
   - Create API documentation updates
